# About
Using React and Rapid API, the project creates a modern fitness and exercise web application. [ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/), [Youtube Search and Download](https://rapidapi.com/h0p3rwe/api/youtube-search-and-download/), and [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/) provide quick and easy access to a wide variety of exercise data. As a result, this web application can return an abundance of results when users search for exercises, muscle groups, body parts, or types of equipment. 

Users are presented with this data in cards. The cards contain GIF animations that show how each exercise is performed and which muscle groups are targeted. Clicking on any card will take the user to a more detailed page of the exercise and will show relevant YouTube videos and similar exercises. There are also buttons (that act like tags) and titles on each card. Users can click on each button to access the corresponding collection of exercises.
